To synchronize time between different servers
Vi /etc/ntp.conf
Add the following line
Server ip iburst
Replace ip in above command with the ip address of the server with which you want to sync time.
And then use following command
/etc/init.d/ntpd restart

https://www.rootusers.com/how-to-synchronize-time-in-linux-with-ntp-peers/
Taking backup of a node

To fully restore data, you must have a complete backup, which consists of the following:

• A snapshot at a point in time
• All incremental backups from the time you took the snapshot
• All commitlog segments since the time you took the last incremental
backup

Cassandra can only restore data from a snapshot when the table schema exists. If the schema does not exist and has not been backed up, you must recreate the schema.
First take backup of schema via 
./cqlsh 172.16.128.130 -e "DESC SCHEMA" > db_schema.cql

To recreate the schema, 
./cqlsh 172.16.128.130 -e "SOURCE '/home/cass/share/cassandra/data/hss_1/subscriber_master_table-abd04bf00c9711e8b214c75879db7963/snapshots/1518439698119/schema.cql'"
1.The nodetool clearsnapshot command removes all existing snapshot files from the snapshot directory of each keyspace. You should make it part of your back-up process to clear old snapshots before taking a new one.
./nodetool clearsnapshot

2. To take snapshot of all the keyspaces on a node:
./nodetool snapshot
The snapshot is created in data_directory/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/snapshots/snapshot_name directory.

3. To use the snapshot, copy all the snapshot files into the data/keyspace/table-uuid folder
e.g. cp snapshots/1303701623423/* /home/cass/share/cassandra/data/hss_1/subscriber_master_table-abd04bf00c9711e8b214c75879db7963/
(here hss_1 is the keyspace and subscriber_master_table is the table name)

4. If incremental_backups was set as true in yaml, copy all the files in the data/keyspace/table-uuid/backup/ folder into data/keyspace/table-uuid/.

5. Run the nodetool refresh command, specifying the keyspace and table name.
./nodetool refresh hss_1 subscriber_master_table

6. Run nodetool repair at the end on all replicas.
The snapshots and incremental backup files are not automatically deleted, therefore you’ll have to manually delete the older backup files.

To restore a node from a snapshot and incremental backups:
1.	Shut down the node to be restored.
2.	Clear all files the /var/lib/cassandra/commitlog (by default).
3.	Clear all *.db files in <data_directory_location>/<keyspace_name>, but DO NOT delete the /snapshots and /backupssubdirectories.
4.	Locate the most recent snapshot folder in <data_directory_location>/<keyspace_name>/snapshots/<snapshot_name>, and copy its contents into <data_directory_location>/<keyspace_name>.
5.	If using incremental backups as well, copy all contents of <data_directory_location>/<keyspace_name>/backups into <data_directory_location>/<keyspace_name>.
6.	Restart the node, keeping in mind that a temporary burst of I/O activity will consume a large amount of CPU resources.


Restoring a snapshot into a new cluster
(When we have to recover data from a snapshot from some other cluster into some new cluster)

First we have to setup the new cluster with exact same settings as were there in the older cluster. Also we’ll have to use the same tokens for each of the nodes.
1.	In the yaml file, uncomment the ‘initial_token’ and specify the tokens you want the node to use. Also make sure all other configurations are same as before.
2.	Delete all the data from data/system folder i.e. rm –rf *
3.	Start the node.
4.	All the schemas from the old cluster must be reproduced in the new cluster.
5.	Stop the node.
6.	Copy all the files from the snapshot directory into the relevant table’s directory in the new cluster.
7.	Restart the node.

Adding a new node

Edit the topology files of all nodes. Start the new node and then run nodetool repair on all nodes after the new node has been added. Lastly, run nodetool cleanup.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24559907/cassandra-avoid-nodetool-cleanup

Replacing a dead node
In order to replace a dead node, start cassandra with the JVM startup flag -Dcassandra.replace_address_first_boot=<dead_node_ip>. Once this property is enabled the node starts in a hibernate state, during which all the other nodes will see this node to be down.
The replacing node will now start to bootstrap the data from the rest of the nodes in the cluster. The main difference between normal bootstrapping of a new node is that this new node will not accept any writes during this phase.
Once the bootstrapping is complete the node will be marked “UP”, we rely on the hinted handoff’s for making this node consistent (since we don’t accept writes since the start of the bootstrap).
Note
If the replacement process takes longer than max_hint_window_in_ms you MUST run repair to make the replaced node consistent again, since it missed ongoing writes during bootstrapping.

Using nodetool from remote server

On the Cassandra node, in the Cassandra-env.sh file, uncomment the following line:
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=172.16.129.67"

“if [ "x$LOCAL_JMX" = "x" ]; then
    LOCAL_JMX=no
Fi”

if [ "$LOCAL_JMX" = "yes" ]; then
  JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.jmx.local.port=$JMX_PORT -XX:+DisableExplicitGC"
else
  JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=$JMX_PORT"
  JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=$JMX_PORT"
  JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"
  JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false"
  JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=/etc/cassandra/jmxremote.password"

On the remote server, use nodetool like following:
./nodetool –p 7199 –h 172.16.129.67 status

Set password on JMX port

1.	Edit below lines in Cassandra-env.sh file:
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true"
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=path to jmxremote.password file"

2.	Copy the jmxremote.password.template from /<jre_install_dir>/lib/management/ to path given above and rename to jmxremote.password
3.	Change ownership to cassandra and permission.
4.	Edit jmxremote.password and add the user and password:
cassandra_test test_pwd
To find out the jre version being used by Cassandra first find out the PID of Cassandra and then
sudo lsof -p 27039 | grep jre

5.	Add cassandra_test with readwrite permission to /<jre_install_dir>/lib/management/jmxremote.access:
monitorRole readonly
Cassandra_test readwrite
controlRole readwrite \
create javax.management.monitor.*,javax.management.timer.* \
unregister
6. Restart Cassandra
7. Run nodetool with user and password:
nodetool -u Cassandra_test -pw test_pwd status

Linux Procedures

To check whether the shell is login-shell or not

Echo $0
If bash then it’s a non login shell if –bash then it’s a login shell

The importance of using a login shell is the any settings in `/home/user/.bash_profile` will get executed. Here is a little more information if you are interested (from `man bash`)

When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and
executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile,
~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.
The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

offset will give the time difference
https://superuser.com/questions/408753/determine-the-time-difference-between-two-linux-servers


To check the number of hard disks in the system

ls /dev/sd(tab)
the number of names without number is the count of the disks.
The name with numbers are the partitions.

To check which process is using a particular port
netstat -tulpn | grep 9042

To check communication between ports is possible

nc ip port_no //on server (ip is server ip)
nc –v -w2 ip port_no //on client(ip is server ip)


T
To open port

Iptables –I input –p tcp –m tcp –dport port_no –j ACCEPT

To check latency of tcp port

time nc –zw30 <host> <port>

to monitor tcp traffic on a port

tcpdump –A –i eth0 port 7000

Configuring multiple IP address to a single interface:



First find out which IP addresses are being used in your network..

nmap -sn -n 172.16.128.0/25
use the above command as root

if you don’t have root permission, check whether a given ip address is being used in your local network by doing following steps:

ping -c 1 -W 1 IP_Address
arp -a -n|grep -w IP_Address

https://serverfault.com/questions/912433/finding-unused-ip-addresses-on-my-network-in-linux/912454#912454

After that configure multiple virtual interfaces binded to the same physical interface
# cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
# cp ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0:0
# cp ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0:1
# cp ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0:2

Cassandra Info


PORTS in Cassandra

https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/security/secureFireWall_r.html

There are three primary ports of interest to Cassandra: 7000 (or 7001 if SSL/TLS is enabled), 7199, and 9160. Port 7000/7001 is used by Cassandra for cluster communication. This includes things such as the Gossip protocol and failure detection. Port 7199 is used by JMX. Port 9160 is the Thrift port and is used for client communication. In order for your cluster to function properly, all of these ports should be accessible.

Latest

http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/faq/index.html#what-ports

By default, Cassandra uses 7000 for cluster communication (7001 if SSL is enabled), 9042 for native protocol clients, and 7199 for JMX. The internode communication and native protocol ports are configurable in the Cassandra Configuration File. The JMX port is configurable in cassandra-env.sh (through JVM options). All ports are TCP.

To check if a given port of a given IP is open for external communication
nc –vn IP Port_No

systemd is the first daemon to start during booting and the last daemon to terminate during shutdown.

Unit files[edit]
systemd records initialization instructions for each daemon in a configuration file (referred to as a "unit file") that uses a declarative language, replacing the traditionally used per-daemon startup shell scripts. There are different types of unit files e.g. service units, target units, socket units, timer units (replacement for cron) etc. 
•	service
•	socket
•	device
•	mount
•	automount
•	swap
•	target
•	path
•	timer (which can be used as a cron-like job scheduler[16])
•	snapshot
•	slice (used to group and manage processes and resources[17])
•	scope

Unit file paths
1. /lib/systemd/system
For package-installed units

2. /etc/systemd/system
For administrator configured units

3. /run/systemd/system
For non persistent run time modifications

Unit files follow the naming convention:
name.type
e.g. ABC.service, SSH.socket etc


Each unit file has got 2 sections called [Unit] (contains description and dependencies) and [Install]

Service unit has got one extra section called [Service]
•	[Unit] — contains generic options that are not dependent on the type of the unit. These options provide unit description, specify the unit's behavior, and set dependencies to other units.
•	[unit type] — if a unit has type-specific directives, these are grouped under a section named after the unit type. 
•	[Install] — contains information about unit installation used by systemctl enable and disable commands.

Service units:
A unit configuration file whose name ends in .service encodes
information about a process controlled and supervised by systemd.
— systemd.service(5)
Systemd service units are the units that actually execute and keep track of programs and daemons, and dependencies are used to make sure that services are started in the right order. They are the most commonly used type of units.
Reference: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/sect-managing_services_with_systemd-unit_files

Target units:
A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".target" encodes
information about a target unit of systemd, which is used for grouping
units and as well-known synchronization points during start-up.
— systemd.target(5)
Targets are used for grouping and ordering units. They are somewhat of a rough equivalent to runlevels in that at different targets, different services, sockets, and other units are started. Unlike runlevels, they are much more free-form and you can easily make your own targets for ordering units, and targets have dependencies among themselves.
For instance, multi-user.target is what most daemons are grouped under, and it requires basic.target to be activated, which means that all services grouped under basic.target will be started before the ones in multi-user.target.

Slices/Control Groups
Systemd organizes processes in control groups. These are kernel level controllers that allow us to manage resource use on a system.  For example, all the processes started by an apache webserver will be in the same control group, CGI scripts included. This makes stopping an apache webserver much easier. This also moves the resource management settings from the process level to the application level by binding the system of CGroup hierarchies with the Systemd unit tree.

3 default cgroups: system, user and machine. Each of these cgroups is also known as a “slice”.

The three top level slices all have specific workloads that end up as sub-slices.
•	System is where daemons and services are placed.
•	User is where user sessions are placed. Each user gets a single slice under the main group, multiple logins using the same UID *do not* create more slices. This prevents clever nerds from stealing more resources than they are allowed.
•	Machine is where hosted virtual machines are placed, such as KVM guests.

With systemd it no longer necessary to create the cgroup manually. Instead, systemd introduces a new concept of slice, which is used to manage resources of a group of processes. Most services are placed in system.slice.

system processes get 1024 CPUShares, user processes 1024 CPUShares and virtual machines 1024 CPUShares, which means 33% of CPU each by default (you will only see it if each category executes some tasks). However, each of these can be configured.

One method of controlling resource usage is with the concept of “shares”. Shares are a relative value and the actual numbers only matter when compared to other values in the same cgroup. By default, slices are set to a value of 1024. So in our system slice above, httpd, sshd, crond and gdm are each set to use 1024 CPU shares. System, User and Machine are each set to 1024 themselves. If you’re having a hard time visualizing that, sometimes looking at it in the form of a tree helps:
•	System - 1024
o	httpd - 1024
o	sshd - 1024
o	crond - 1024
o	gdm - 1024
•	User - 1024
o	bash (mrichter) - 1024
o	bash (dorf) - 1024
•	Machine - 1024
o	testvm - 1024
In this case, we have a few daemons running, two users logged in (you’ll meet both of them later) and a single virtual machine.

Every slice has multiple properties that can be set on it. As is always the case in Linux, we can create configuration files by hand or use the command line to set them.

systemctl commands

Older Command	systemctl equivalent	Description
halt	systemctl halt	Halts the system
poweroff	systemctl poweroff	Powers off the system
reboot	systemctl reboot	Restarts the system
pm-suspend	systemctl suspend	Suspends the system
pm-hibernate	systemctl hibernate	Hibernates the system
pm-suspend-hybrid	systemctl hybrid-sleep	Hibernates and suspends the system


Suspend
– Suspending the system saves the system state in RAM and with the exception of the RAM module, powers off most of the devices in the machine.
– When you turn the machine back on, the system then restores its state from RAM without having to boot again.
– Because the system state is saved in RAM and not on the hard disk, restoring the system from suspend mode is significantly faster than restoring it from hibernation, but as a consequence, a suspended system state is also vulnerable to power outages.

Listing running services
systemctl
to get the full hierarchy of control groups

systemd-cgls
To get the list of control group ordered by CPU, memory and disk I/O load, type:
systemd-cgtop

To allocate 70% of CPU to the system processes, 20% of CPU to the user processes and 10% of CPU to the virtual machines, type:
# systemctl set-property system.slice CPUShares=7168
# systemctl set-property user.slice CPUShares=2048
# systemctl set-property machine.slice CPUShares=1024
Note: Rebooting might be necessary to see the changes.
To restrict the user with the uid 1000 to use less than 20% of cpu, type:
# systemctl set-property user-1000.slice CPUQuota=20%
To reduce the memory available for the same user to 1GB, type:
# systemctl set-property user-1000.slice MemoryLimit=1024M
To limit the mariadb service to write below 2MB/s onto the /dev/vdb partition, type:
# systemctl set-property mariadb.service BlockIOWriteBandwidth="/dev/vdb 2M"
(reference: https://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-get-started-cgroups/)
To get the slice name of a particular service
systemctl show -p Slice foo.service

To change the CPU usage limit of a service
systemctl set-property foo.service CPUShares=250(The systemd.resource-control(5) man page has more information about cgroups-related parameters that you can pass to systemctl.)
Setting the property caused additional file 90-CPUShares.conf to be created under /etc/systemd/system/foo.service.d. This file contains parameters to be appended to the configuration of foo.service unit. Actually applying the change requires reloading systemd and restarting foo.service:
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart foo.service
To cap a user’s(UID 1000) RAM
systemctl set-property user-1000.slice MemoryLimit=200M(200 MB is excluding swap space)

Restarting on exit
By default, systemd does not restart your service if the program exits for whatever reason. This is usually not what you want for a service that must be always available, so we’re instructing it to always restart on exit:
Restart=always
You could also use on-failure to only restart if the exit status is not 0.
By default, systemd attempts a restart after 100ms. You can specify the number of seconds to wait before attempting a restart, using:
RestartSec=1
